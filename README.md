**App Idea**

I want to create an app that will allow people in need to find the closest free food near them. I grew up in West Baltimore, an area in which many people deal with food insecurity. Although Baltimore is home to a plethora of food pantries and food-based non-profits, residents struggle to find free or affordable food options. Because of poor funding, small non-profits struggle to get the word out about what they do. As a result, residents are left hungry and organizations aren't serving as much people as they could, leaving them with underwhelming numbers on grant applications. 
My app would remedy this problem by connecting residents with the closest food distribution center to them and offering filters that curate the results to the needs of the resident. Residents would easily filter for locations that are in walking distance, locations that offer delivery, and locations that offer a specific food type such as meat or produce. My hope is that the app would be user-friendly, aesthetically-pleasing, and functional in low-internet or offline settings. 

## Notes

The storyboard interface was easy to use and has inspired me to continue exploring the world of iOS app development!
